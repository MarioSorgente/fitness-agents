/**
 * Agent: Nutrition plan writer / "Nutrition coach" (steps `nutrition_plan_writer` + `nutrition_plan_challenge`).
 *
 * Role: own the full NUTRITION domain — analysis (absorbs the former `nutrition_reviewer`) and the
 * WRITE-UP as Markdown (daily targets, Mon–Fri meal table, peri-workout fueling, alternatives,
 * per-phase scaling). Runs twice:
 *   1. DRAFT  — `buildNutritionPlanWriterSystemPrompt` (independent, async with the training draft).
 *   2. CHALLENGE — `buildNutritionPlanChallengePrompt` (sees the training draft, challenges it, and
 *      revises the nutrition plan so the combined fitness+nutrition program is coherent).
 *
 * Audit note: draft AND revised (challenge) outputs are both stored in `agentOutputs`, so diffing
 * them is the machine-readable "audit log of decisions" — the client document stays clean Markdown.
